## Introduction

Choosing a solar installer in Dhule or anywhere in Maharashtra is not like buying a new phone you’ll replace in 2–3 years. A rooftop solar system is a 20–25 year asset. If the design is wrong or the installer disappears after taking payment, you’re stuck with the consequences for decades.

Maharashtra sits in India’s high-solar belt, getting roughly 5–6.5 kWh/m² of solar energy per day and 250–300 sunny days in a year, which makes rooftop solar extremely effective here.  Dhule district itself already hosts large solar parks and utility-scale projects, which shows how strong the solar resource is in this region. 

The question is not “Does solar work here?”  
The real question is: **“Which EPC company can I trust to design, install and maintain it properly?”**

This guide gives you a clear, Dhule– and Maharashtra–focused checklist to compare installers before you sign anything.

## What a Solar EPC Partner Actually Does

EPC stands for **Engineering, Procurement and Construction**:

- **Engineering** – site survey, system design, structural and electrical design, energy yield estimates.   
- **Procurement** – sourcing panels, inverters, structures, cables and protection devices from reliable manufacturers.
- **Construction** – installation, mounting, wiring, testing, net-metering formalities and handover.

Good EPC companies also:

- Handle **subsidy documentation** under schemes like PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana for residential projects.   
- Ensure **ALMM-compliant modules** and updated standards are followed.   
- Support **net metering**, which Maharashtra’s regulator recently reaffirmed for rooftop solar projects, keeping payback periods attractive.   

If an installer can’t clearly explain these responsibilities, that’s already a warning sign.

## Step 1 – Basic Legitimacy: Filters Before You Talk Price

Start with simple, non-negotiable checks. If any answer here is “no”, you move on.

### 1.1 Business registration and invoicing

Ask:

- Is the installer a **registered business** (GST-registered, with a verifiable address and PAN)?  
- Will you get **tax invoices in the company name**?

Without proper invoicing, you will struggle with:

- Warranty claims  
- Loan processing / EMI  
- Future resale or accounting

### 1.2 Approvals and empanelment

For residential systems, the installer should be familiar with:

- PM Surya Ghar subsidy process (central scheme with up to ₹78,000 subsidy per home, depending on system size).   
- Maharashtra DISCOM processes via MSEDCL’s rooftop solar/ISMART portals.   

If they claim subsidies but can’t show process flows, documentation samples or portal screenshots, treat that as a red flag.

### 1.3 Local presence in Dhule / nearby Maharashtra

You want:

- A **local or nearby office** in Dhule or surrounding North Maharashtra  
- A reachable local service team  
- Clear response-time commitments (e.g., “we visit within 48–72 hours for genuine faults”)

Installers far away can still build systems, but they rarely respond fast when something breaks in peak summer.

---

## Step 2 – Technical Design Quality (Where Corners Are Usually Cut)

The difference between a safe, high-performing system and a headache usually shows up here.

### 2.1 Detailed site survey, not just photos

A serious EPC team will:

- Visit your site physically  
- Check **shadow patterns** (nearby buildings, trees, mobile towers)  
- Inspect roof condition (RCC, sheet, tile, existing waterproofing)  
- Plan cable routing and earthing locations carefully

Shaky surveys = shaky designs. Many post-installation generation complaints are simply “we didn’t realise that tree shadow hits the array at 3 pm”.

### 2.2 Proper system sizing

A good installer will design based on:   

- Your **average monthly consumption** (units in kWh)  
- Tariff slab (MSEDCL bill structure)  
- Sanctioned load and phase (single / three-phase)  
- Future plans: EV, more ACs, new floors, shop expansion, etc.

If someone pushes “5 kW for everyone” type packages without looking at your bills, they’re optimising for their sales, not your payback.

### 2.3 ALMM-compliant, quality components

India now enforces an **Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM)** for solar modules, with List-I for modules already in place and List-II for solar cells coming into force from 2026.   

Ask clearly:

- Are the **modules on the latest ALMM List-I** from MNRE?  
- What is the panel **performance warranty** (typically 25 years)?  
- Which inverter brands are they offering, and what is the standard warranty (5–10 years)?  

Cheap, non-listed modules might save a small amount today and cost you big generation losses later.

### 2.4 Electrical safety and protection

Serious EPCs treat solar as an electrical system first, not a “panel product”. Good practice includes:   

- **DC and AC surge protection devices (SPDs)**  
- **DC isolators** near the array  
- Adequate cable sizing and UV-resistant DC cables  
- Proper MC4 connectors, not taped joints  
- Separate **earthing** for DC and AC, lightning arrestor for larger systems  
- MCB/MCCB protection and labelling inside your distribution board

If the quote is vague like “standard wiring and protection”, push for specifics or walk away.

---

## Step 3 – Transparent Proposal and Honest Pricing

Once an installer passes the first technical filters, move to the commercial side.

### 3.1 What a good proposal includes

A trustworthy Dhule/Maharashtra EPC quote should clearly show:

- System size (kW)  
- Expected **annual generation in kWh**, based on local solar irradiation (Maharashtra gets high annual radiation compared to many other states).   
- Assumptions used:
  - Average daily sun-hours
  - Your current annual consumption
  - Unit rate used (₹/kWh)  

- Full **Bill of Materials (BOM)**:  
  - Panel brand, model, wattage  
  - Inverter brand, rating, phase  
  - Structure type (RCC mount / sheet clamp / elevated structure)  
  - DC/AC cables, SPDs, earthing kit  

- Cost breakup:
  - Material cost  
  - Labour and installation  
  - Any civil work (elevated structures, waterproofing, etc.)  
  - GST  

- Details of:
  - Net-metering charges (if any)  
  - Application / processing fees  
  - Subsidy handling charges (if applicable)

### 3.2 Red flags in quotes

Avoid installers who:

- Give only a one-line price: “5 kW solar – ₹X all-inclusive” with no breakup  
- Refuse to specify brands until “after payment”  
- Are vague about what is included (no mention of structure, earthing, SPDs etc.)

The cheapest quote is often cheap because **critical safety and reliability items are missing**.

## Step 4 – Subsidy, Net Metering and Regulatory Compliance

### 4.1 PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana

For residential customers, the **PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana** provides central subsidies for rooftop solar:

- ~₹30,000 per kW up to 2 kW  
- ~₹18,000 per kW for the next 1 kW  
- Maximum subsidy typically capped at ₹78,000 for systems larger than 3 kW   

Exact numbers and conditions can change, so installers must use **current** guidelines from the official portals and MSEDCL notices.

A good EPC company will:

- Help you register on the official portal  
- Upload necessary documents (Aadhaar, bill, property proof, etc.)  
- Coordinate DISCOM inspection and commissioning  
- Explain the **actual subsidy amount** you can expect and timelines for release

### 4.2 Net metering in Maharashtra

Maharashtra’s electricity regulator (MERC) has recently upheld net metering for rooftop solar in a key decision, confirming that eligible consumers can still offset their consumption by exporting surplus energy to the grid.   

Ask your installer:

- Are they up to date with MERC’s latest orders?  
- Will your system be commissioned under **net metering** or **gross metering**?  
- How will that affect your **payback period**?

If an installer cannot explain the difference between net and gross metering, you should not trust them with a 25-year asset.

---

## Step 5 – After-Sales Service and Monitoring

The work is not over after installation.

### 5.1 Warranties beyond panels

You should get:

- Panel performance warranty (typ. 25 years) + product warranty (10–12 years)  
- Inverter warranty (5–10 years, depending on brand)  
- **Workmanship warranty** from the EPC (for structure, wiring, terminations)

Clarify:

- Who handles warranty claims – you or the EPC?  
- Is there a dedicated service contact?  
- What are the service charges after the workmanship warranty period?

### 5.2 Monitoring and performance checks

Most modern inverters offer app-based monitoring. A good EPC will:

- Commission and configure the monitoring app for you  
- Explain what to look at (daily generation, grid issues)  
- Offer periodic health checks or AMC for:
  - Cleaning schedule (dust-heavy in Dhule and much of Maharashtra)  
  - Tightness checks on structures  
  - Earthing and insulation testing

---

## Step 6 – Dhule and Maharashtra Specific Factors You Should Consider

Dhule and broader Maharashtra share some practical realities:

- **High dust and heat in many regions** – panels need regular cleaning to maintain generation.  
- **Mix of urban roofs and rural/agri structures** – from RCC terraces to GI sheds and farm sheds.  
- **Strong solar resource** and rising local tariffs – good for payback if the system is well-designed.   

A local EPC that understands wind loads, monsoon patterns, local DISCOM behaviour and municipal norms will usually do a better job than a distant “one size fits all” vendor.

## FAQ: Common Questions from Dhule and Maharashtra Customers

### 1. Which panel brand is best for Dhule and Maharashtra?

Instead of chasing brand names, focus on:

- Whether the panel is on **MNRE’s ALMM List-I**  
- Performance and product warranty  
- Track record of the manufacturer in India   

A competent EPC will shortlist a few brands that work well for our climate and budget.

### 2. How long does it take from booking to commissioning?

For a typical 3–10 kW residential system:

- Site survey and design: a few days  
- Application and approvals: depends on MSEDCL workflow at that time  
- Installation: usually 2–4 days of work  
- Net-metering and final commissioning: varies by location and load on DISCOM, often a few weeks

Ask the installer for realistic timelines based on recent projects in your area.

### 3. What happens if my inverter shows an error?

In many cases, inverter errors are linked to:

- Grid issues (voltage or frequency out of range)  
- Loose connections or earthing problems  
- Component failures (rare but possible)

Your installer should:

- Provide a **service number** or WhatsApp channel  
- Have a standard troubleshooting script (restart steps, photos, error code sharing)  
- Offer on-site visits within a defined time frame for genuine faults

### 4. Can I oversize my solar plant to earn money by selling more power?

Maharashtra’s net-metering framework is designed primarily for **self-consumption**, not for running a power plant on a residential connection.   

The sensible approach is to size your system:

- Close to your **annual consumption**,  
- Within the DISCOM’s sanctioned load and technical rules.

A good EPC will show you a financial model that balances export and self-use instead of blindly pushing maximum capacity.
