If you live in Dhule, Jalgaon, or anywhere in North Maharashtra, you’ve probably heard this line:

> “Government se subsidy milti hai solar pe, but process bahut jhanjhat wala hai.”

The first half is true.  
The second half **doesn’t have to be**—if you know the steps and have the right EPC partner.

This guide explains:

- How the **central government subsidy** (PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana) works in Maharashtra  
- How much money you can realistically expect  
- Who is eligible and what the process looks like  
- How **Ultron Power Systems** helps you from portal registration to subsidy credit

## 1. What Subsidy Can You Get in Maharashtra?

For most **residential rooftop** systems in Maharashtra, the main scheme is:

### PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana (Central Government)

Under this scheme, residential consumers installing on-grid rooftop systems can get:

- **₹30,000 per kW** for the first **2 kW**  
- **₹18,000 per kW** for the next **1 kW** (up to 3 kW)  
- **Subsidy capped at ₹78,000** for systems **3 kW and above**

So:

- **1 kW system** → ₹30,000 subsidy  
- **2 kW system** → ₹60,000 subsidy  
- **3 kW system** → ₹78,000 subsidy  
- **4 kW, 5 kW, 10 kW…** → still **₹78,000** max subsidy (central)

On top of this, there are **special schemes** and **extra support** for:

- Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS)  
- Some specific categories like SC/ST in certain state programmes  

These can push the effective subsidy even higher for eligible households, sometimes covering **90–95% of system cost** for small 1 kW setups designed for low-usage homes.

For a typical middle-class home in Dhule or Jalgaon installing **2–3 kW**, the central subsidy alone usually covers a **big chunk** of the cost.

## 2. Who Is Eligible for Subsidy?

In simple terms, you’re usually eligible if:

- You are a **residential consumer** (individual house, flat, housing society)  
- You have a **valid electricity connection** in your name with MSEDCL or relevant DISCOM  
- You have **suitable rooftop space** (shadow-free, structurally sound)  
- You are installing an **on-grid rooftop system** (not just a random off-grid inverter)  
- You apply **through the official PM Surya Ghar portal** and follow the process

Common restrictions:

- Subsidy is primarily for **residential** category, not standard commercial/industrial meters  
- You generally **can’t claim subsidy twice** for the same connection/rooftop  
- The system must be installed by a **registered/empanelled vendor** as per portal norms

If you’re not sure whether your home qualifies, a quick feasibility check by Ultron’s team clears that up before you spend anything.

## 3. How the Subsidy Process Works (Step by Step)

Here’s the typical flow for a homeowner in Maharashtra:

### Step 1: Portal Registration

1. Visit the **PM Surya Ghar** (National Rooftop Solar) portal.  
2. Select:
   - State: **Maharashtra**  
   - Your **DISCOM** (e.g., MSEDCL)  
3. Enter your **consumer number** from your electricity bill.  
4. Verify via **OTP** and create your login.

### Step 2: Rooftop Solar Application

You submit an application with:

- Proposed system size (e.g., **3 kW**)  
- Basic roof details  
- Installer/vendor (must be empanelled as per the scheme)

At this stage, **Ultron Power Systems** helps you:

- Decide the **right capacity** based on your load pattern and roof  
- Ensure application details (name, address, load, category) match your bill  
- Avoid common rejection reasons (wrong category, mismatched details, etc.)

### Step 3: Feasibility & Approval from DISCOM

Your DISCOM (e.g., MSEDCL) checks:

- Whether your connection is suitable  
- Technical feasibility (transformer loading, phase, etc.)

They issue a **feasibility approval**.  
Only after this you should move to full installation.

### Step 4: System Design, Supply & Installation

Your EPC partner (Ultron) handles:

- Site visit and **final design** (panel layout, inverter sizing, string design)  
- Supply of **MNRE-compliant modules and inverters**  
- Structure, wiring, earthing, DC/AC protection, and safety hardware  
- On-site installation by trained technicians

All of this must match the **standards required by the scheme**.

### Step 5: Net Metering & Inspection

After installation:

1. Your DISCOM does **inspection** / commissioning check  
2. **Net meter** is installed or existing meter is replaced  
3. The system is officially **commissioned** and connected to the grid

We coordinate with the local MSEDCL office, arrange required documents and forms, and ensure photos, wiring diagrams, and test reports are as per format.

### Step 6: Uploading Documents on Portal

Post-commissioning, you or your vendor must upload:

- Commissioning photos (modules, inverter, net meter, nameplate details)  
- Installation report  
- Net meter details  
- Invoices with GST details and payment proof

If everything is in order, your application moves to **subsidy approval**.

### Step 7: Subsidy Credited via DBT

Finally:

- Subsidy is **directly transferred** to your **bank account** (Direct Benefit Transfer)  
- You get SMS/email confirmation from the portal/DISCOM

From your side, total paperwork looks like a headache.  
From our side, it’s just **another Tuesday**.

## 4. How Much Money Do People Actually Save?

Let’s take a typical example for Dhule / North Maharashtra:

### Example: 3 kW Residential System (On-Grid)

- **Indicative system + installation cost:** ~₹2.0–₹2.2 lakh  
- **Central subsidy (up to 3 kW):** ₹78,000  
- **Net cost after subsidy:** roughly ₹1.2–₹1.4 lakh (approx.)

Generation:

- **3 kW** system → roughly **360–450 units/month** (depending on season & rooftop)  
- At a blended tariff of **₹8–₹10/unit**, that’s **₹2,800–₹4,000/month** of savings

Rough **simple payback**:

- Around **3.5–5 years** in many cases  

After that, you’re effectively running on **deeply discounted power for the remaining 20+ years** of the system life.

## 5. Common Mistakes That Can Kill Your Subsidy

Lots of people lose subsidy or face delays because of simple errors:

- Installing the system **before** portal feasibility approval  
- Using a **non-empanelled** or non-compliant vendor  
- Mismatch between **bill details and application details** (name, address, category)  
- Missing or poor-quality **photos** and **technical documents**  
- No proper **net-metering application** or incomplete forms

By the time they realise, it’s too late—the system is installed, money spent, and the subsidy is either delayed for months or rejected.

That’s exactly what we try to prevent.

## 6. Why Choose Ultron Power Systems for Subsidy-Backed Solar?

You’re not just buying panels. You’re buying:

- **Design**  
- **Execution**  
- **Paperwork**  
- **Support for 20+ years**

Here’s what we do differently for Dhule, Jalgaon, and North Maharashtra homes:

### a) End-to-End Subsidy & Net Metering Support

- Help you register on the **PM Surya Ghar portal**  
- Fill **online applications** correctly (no guesswork)  
- Coordinate for **feasibility approvals** with MSEDCL  
- Prepare and upload **photos, commissioning reports, and invoices** as per requirement  
- Track your application status and guide you till **DBT credit** hits your account

You focus on **choosing the right system** and **paying less on your bills**.  
We handle the **boring part**.

### b) Compliance-First Engineering

Our systems are designed so that:

- All modules and inverters meet **MNRE and DISCOM norms**  
- Earthing, protections, cable sizing, and structure follow **good engineering practice**  
- Documents (SLD, test results, panel layout) are ready when inspectors ask

That means **fewer objections**, smoother inspections, and **faster commissioning**.

### c) Local Presence, Real Projects

We’re not a random website selling pan-India packages.

- We actually **install systems in Dhule, Jalgaon & North Maharashtra**  
- We know local:
  - DISCOM offices  
  - Typical roof types  
  - Common inspection points and objections  

You get **local experience**, not trial-and-error.

## 7. Is Now the Right Time to Apply?

Short answer: **Yes**, if:

- Your **monthly bill** is consistently high (₹3,000+)  
- You own your roof and don’t plan to shift in the next 5–10 years  
- Your roof has **shadow-free space** (roughly 100 sq. ft per kW)  
- You’re okay with **3–5 year payback** in exchange for decades of savings

Subsidy schemes, by definition, don’t last forever.  
Doing nothing is basically a decision to:

- Keep paying higher tariffs every year  
- Let the sun work **against** you instead of **for** you
