## Introduction

On February 13, 2024, the Prime Minister announced the **PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana**. The headline promise? **Free electricity for 1 crore households.**

But typical of government schemes, the fine print can be confusing.
*   "I live in a rented flat. Am I eligible?"
*   "I have a commercial shop. Do I get the subsidy?"
*   "What documents do I really need?"

Instead of reading a 50-page PDF, we built a simple tool to tell you where you stand.

## The Core Benefit: ₹78,000 Flat

Under the new scheme, the subsidy amounts are fixed and generous:

*   **1 kW System:** ₹30,000 Subsidy
*   **2 kW System:** ₹60,000 Subsidy
*   **3 kW System & Above:** **₹78,000 Subsidy (Fixed Cap)**

This money comes directly to your bank account within 30-45 days of installation. It is not a discount given by the dealer; it is a Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) from the Central Government.

## The Eligibility Criteria (Simplified)

There are three non-negotiable rules for the residential subsidy:

1.  **Residential Connection:** Your meter must be "Residential". Commercial, Industrial, or Agricultural meters do not qualify for *this specific* scheme (Farmers have PM-KUSUM instead).
2.  **Ownership:** You must own the roof rights. If you live in an apartment, you need roof rights or a Common Area connection. Tenants cannot apply directly.
3.  **Active Connection:** You must have an active consumer number with MSEDCL (Mahavitaran).

## Stop Guessing. Use the Wizard.

We created the **[Subsidy Eligibility Wizard](/tools/subsidy-wizard)** to filter through the edge cases.

### What the Tool Checks:
1.  **Sector Validation:** Are you Residential, Farm, or Commercial?
2.  **Property Status:** Owner vs Tenant check.
3.  **Outcome:** It instantly tells you:
    *   ✅ **ELIGIBLE:** You qualify for the full ₹78,000.
    *   ⚠️ **CUSTOM:** You might need a different scheme (like Accelerated Depreciation for businesses).

### Bonus: The Document Checklist
If you are eligible, the tool also generates a **custom checklist** of documents you need to keep ready (like your Index II, Electricity Bill, and Canceled Cheque).
