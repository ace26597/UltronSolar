## Myth 1: Solar Panels Don't Work on Cloudy Days
**Fact:** While solar panels are most effective in direct sunlight, they can still generate electricity on cloudy days. They use diffuse sunlight to produce power, ensuring your home stays powered even when the weather isn't perfect.

## Myth 2: Solar Energy is Too Expensive
**Fact:** The cost of solar panels has dropped significantly over the last decade. Additionally, government incentives and tax credits make going solar more affordable than ever. The long-term savings on electricity bills often outweigh the initial investment.

## Myth 3: Solar Panels Require High Maintenance
**Fact:** Solar panels are incredibly durable and require very little maintenance. They have no moving parts, which means there's less wear and tear. A simple cleaning a few times a year is usually sufficient.

## Myth 4: Solar Panels Will Damage My Roof
**Fact:** When installed correctly by professionals, solar panels actually protect the portion of the roof they cover from elements like rain, snow, and debris.

## Myth 5: I Will Still Have Power During a Blackout
**Fact:** Most standard grid-tied solar systems will shut down during a power outage for safety reasons. However, if you have a battery storage system, you can keep your essential appliances running even when the grid goes down.
