## Myth 1: Solar Panels Don't Work on Cloudy Days
**Fact:** While solar panels are most effective in direct sunlight, they continue generating electricity on cloudy or hazy days. Modern modules capture diffuse light and often produce 15–25% of their rated power even under overcast skies, which keeps critical loads running and balances seasonal variations.

## Myth 2: Solar Energy is Too Expensive
**Fact:** The cost of solar panels has dropped more than 70% in the last decade. Layer subsidies, accelerated depreciation, and GST benefits on top of competitive EPC pricing, and the payback period for most rooftops is now between 3.5 and 5 years. After breakeven, you effectively enjoy free power for the remaining 20+ years of the system’s life.

## Myth 3: Solar Panels Require High Maintenance
**Fact:** Solar panels are incredibly durable and require minimal attention because they have no moving parts. Apart from occasional cleaning and a quick annual inspection, there is very little upkeep. Smart monitoring portals alert you if performance drifts, so you can address issues before they become costly.

## Myth 4: Solar Panels Will Damage My Roof
**Fact:** A professionally engineered mounting structure distributes weight evenly and keeps water from pooling. In many cases the panels shield the roof surface from harsh sun and rain, actually extending the roof’s lifespan. Always insist on structural analysis and high-grade fasteners to eliminate leakage risks.

## Myth 5: I Will Still Have Power During a Blackout
**Fact:** Most grid-tied solar systems shut down during a power outage to protect utility workers. To stay powered, pair your solar array with a hybrid inverter and battery bank or integrate a diesel-sync controller. This keeps essential circuits like lifts, pumps, or cold storage online while the rest of the premises remains safe.

## Key Takeaways for Solar Buyers

- Audit your energy consumption and roof structure before collecting quotes.
- Compare at least two EPC partners on design depth, not just price.
- Ask about remote monitoring and O&M packages so you always know how the system is performing.

Ultron Solar’s engineering team can walk you through feasibility studies, policy paperwork, and turnkey installation so you can focus on the benefits instead of the myths.
