If you’ve ever asked, “3kW system ka kitna kharcha hoga?” you’re not alone.  
Most homeowners in Dhule, Jalgaon, and across North Maharashtra know they *want* solar—but actual pricing, subsidy amounts, and payback are usually confusing or hidden behind sales talk.

Let’s strip the jargon and talk real numbers, in plain language.

## What Actually Decides the Cost of Your Solar System?

The per-kW price you see on WhatsApp forwards is only half the story. Your final cost depends on:

- **System size:** 2kW, 3kW, 5kW, or larger  
- **Type of system:** On-grid vs. hybrid (with battery)  
- **Component quality:** Tier-1 vs cheaper modules, inverter brand, structure quality  
- **Site conditions:** Roof type (RCC / tin shed), cable runs, earthing, safety hardware  
- **Paperwork & service:** Net metering, subsidy applications, commissioning, support

Cheap-looking quotes usually cut corners on structure, cabling, protection devices, or after-sales support—the things you only notice **after** something goes wrong.

## Typical Price Range for 3kW & 5kW Systems (Before Subsidy)

Actual prices vary by brand and site, but as a **rough benchmark** for North Maharashtra:

- **3kW on-grid rooftop system**
  - Typical range: **₹1.8 – ₹2.2 lakh** (before subsidy)
  - Good for: Small homes, 1–2 floor bungalows, small offices

- **5kW on-grid rooftop system**
  - Typical range: **₹2.8 – ₹3.6 lakh** (before subsidy)
  - Good for: Larger homes with ACs, small commercial setups, clinics, small shops

Hybrid (with batteries) will usually cost more. Think of batteries as a separate “backup investment”, not part of basic rooftop cost.

> **Red flag:** If someone quotes 30–40% lower than these ranges, ask what they’re removing—brand, warranty, structure, or safety.

## How Much Does Subsidy Reduce the Cost?

Under schemes like **PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana** and related state policies, residential customers can get significant support on eligible rooftop systems.

As a simplified example (exact norms can change):

- Subsidy up to **₹30,000 per kW for the first 2kW**
- Plus **₹18,000 per kW** for capacity from 2kW to 3kW

So, for a **3kW residential system**:

- Approx. **gross cost:** ₹1.8 – ₹2.2 lakh  
- Approx. **subsidy:** up to around ₹78,000 (if all conditions are met)  
- Approx. **net cost to customer:** often in the **₹1.1 – ₹1.4 lakh** range

For 5kW, subsidy rules are different beyond 3kW, but your **effective per-kW cost still comes down** compared to unsubsidised systems.

A good EPC partner in Dhule or Jalgaon should:

- Confirm which scheme you qualify for  
- Help you register on the official portal  
- File documents correctly so you actually receive the benefit

## What About Monthly Savings and Payback?

Let’s take a **3kW system in Dhule** as a practical example:

- Average generation: **12–15 units per day** (approx. 360–450 units/month)  
- If your tariff is around **₹8 per unit** (blended rate), that’s:
  - **₹2,800 – ₹3,600 per month** of electricity offset

If your **net investment** after subsidy is, say, **₹1.2 – ₹1.4 lakh**, then:

- **Simple payback** is often in the range of **3.5 – 5 years**  
- After that, you’re basically enjoying **20+ years of heavily reduced bills**

For **5kW systems**, absolute savings are higher, but always match size to your **actual consumption and roof space**, not just “bigger is better”.

## Hidden Costs You Should Ask About

When you compare quotes for a 3kW or 5kW system in Maharashtra, ask clearly:

- **Is earthing included?** (chemical / maintenance-free earthing where needed)
- **Are AC & DC protection devices included?** (MCBs/MCCBs, surge protection, isolators)
- **Is scaffolding / labour for difficult roofs accounted for?**
- **Who pays for net-metering fees, DISCOM visits, and paperwork?**
- **Is monitoring included?** (Wi-Fi / 4G dongle, app access, portal setup)

If these are “excluded” or “extra as applicable”, your cheap quote can become expensive quickly.

## 3kW vs 5kW: Which Size Makes Sense?

A quick rule-of-thumb for North Maharashtra rooftops:

- Choose **3kW** if:
  - You have 1–2 ACs and moderate daytime usage
  - Your monthly bill is in the **₹2,500 – ₹4,500** range
  - Roof space available is around **300 sq. ft.** shadow-free

- Choose **5kW** if:
  - You have multiple ACs, fridges, pumps, or a small office/clinic
  - Your monthly bill is typically **₹5,000+**
  - Roof space available is around **500 sq. ft.** shadow-free

Oversizing blindly doesn’t help. Size should match your **consumption pattern, roof, and DISCOM rules**.

## How to Compare Quotes the Smart Way

When two vendors give you a price for 3kW or 5kW:

- Ask for **brand names and model numbers** of modules, inverters, and structures  
- Ask for **clear warranty split:** panels, inverter, workmanship  
- Check if they include **subsidy application support & net-metering**  
- Prefer vendors who show:
  - **String design, layout drawing, and single-line diagram**
  - Past projects in **Dhule / Jalgaon / North Maharashtra**
  - Real monitoring screenshots, not just brochure images

If a vendor cannot explain their design in simple language, they probably haven’t done it properly.
