## Introduction

If you walk into a mobile shop and ask, "What is the rate of a phone per gram?", they will look at you funny. A phone is not just plastic and glass; it is a system of chips, cameras, and software.

Yet, in solar, the first question everyone asks is: *"What is the rate per watt? ₹50? ₹45?"*

This oversimplified number is dangerous. It hides the difference between a system that lasts 25 years and one that rusts in 5.

In this guide, we break down **what you are actually paying for** and introduce our **[Instant Quote Tool](/tools/instant-quote)** that gives you a transparent, detailed estimate in 30 seconds.

## The 4 Pillars of Solar Cost

When you buy a rooftop solar system in Maharashtra, you are paying for four things:

### 1. The Generation Engine (50-60% of cost)
This includes the **Solar Panels** and the **Inverter**.
*   **Panels:** Mono-PERC Half Cut panels (Tier-1 brands like Waaree, Adani) cost more but generate electricity even in low light.
*   **Inverter:** The heart of the system. Cheap inverters fail in heat. Good ones (Growatt, Sofar, Enphase) last for decades.

### 2. The Skeleton (10-15% of cost)
The **Module Mounting Structure (MMS)**.
*   Are you getting pre-galvanized heavy steel or cheap painted iron?
*   Iron rusts. If the structure bends in a storm, your warranty is void. We use only **Hot Dipped Galvanized (HDG)** iron that withstands 150 kmph winds.

### 3. The Veins (10% of cost)
**Cables (AC/DC)** and **Protection Devices (AJB/ACDB)**.
*   Safety is not optional. We need Lightning Arresters (LA), Earthing pits, and fire-proof DC cables. Cutting corners here causes fires.

### 4. The Permissions (Labor & Paperwork)
**Net Metering** with MSEDCL is a painful process. It involves liaisoning, testing charges, and official fees. A good installer includes this in the price (like we do).

## Why "Per Watt" is Misleading

Imagine Installer A quotes **₹50,000 per kW** and Installer B quotes **₹55,000 per kW**.

*   **Installer A:** Poly panels, local structure, thin cables. (Life: ~7-10 years)
*   **Installer B:** Mono-PERC, Galvanized structure, Polycab wires. (Life: ~25 years)

Installer B is actually **cheaper per year of usage**.

## Get a Real Quote in 30 Seconds

We don't believe in hiding prices. You shouldn't have to call 10 people just to know if you can afford solar.

**[Launch the Instant Quote Tool](/tools/instant-quote)**

### What This Tool Does:
1.  **Asks Simple Questions:** Your city, monthly bill, and roof type.
2.  **Analyzes Your Needs:** Calculates the exact system size (kW) required.
3.  **Applies Subsidy:** Automatically subtracts the **PM Surya Ghar** subsidy (₹30k to ₹78k).
4.  **Shows the Final Price:** The "Net Investment" you need to make.

It’s not just a random number. It’s a calculated estimate based on current market rates in North Maharashtra.

## Example Quote: High-Bill Home

Let's say your bill is **₹4,000 / month**.

*   **Step 1:** You enter details in the tool.
*   **Step 2:** Tool recommends a **3 kW System**.
*   **Step 3:** Base Price (approx): ₹1,65,000.
*   **Step 4:** Less Subsidy: -₹78,000.
*   **Final Quote:** **₹87,000**.

*Wait. Only ₹87,000 for a system that usually costs nearly 2 lakhs?*
Yes. That is the power of the new subsidy scheme.

## Transparency First

Pricing changes with market rates, but transparency shouldn't. Before you negotiate on the "per watt" rate, ask for the **Make, Model, and Specs**.

Better yet, generate your own baseline quote first.
