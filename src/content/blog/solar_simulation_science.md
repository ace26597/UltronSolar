## Introduction

In the old days, a solar salesman would look at your roof, lick his thumb, and say, "Sir, put 5kW."

That wasn't engineering; it was guessing.

Today, we use data. We know exactly how much sun falls on Dhule vs Jalgaon. We know the degradation rate of a panel in Year 10. And we can simulate your financial future with high accuracy.

Our **[Solar Savings Calculator](/solar-simulator)** is the first step in this scientific process.

## What is a "Solar Simulation"?

A simulation is a digital twin of reality. Before we drill a single hole in your roof, we want to know:
1.  **Generation Potential:** How many units will this system produce in May vs December?
2.  **Financial Degradation:** How does the output drop by 0.6% every year?
3.  **Tariff Inflation:** If electricity rates rise by 5% yearly, how much more do you save in 2030?

## The "Quick Estimate" Engine

Our current **[Solar Simulator](/solar-simulator)** runs a "Quick Estimate" model designed for speed.

It inputs your **Electricity Bill Amount** and runs the following logic:

### 1. The Energy-to-Power Ratio
It reverse-calculates your consumption.
*   *Bill: ₹3,000* -> *Units: ~350 kWh.*
*   *Irradiance Factor:* In our region, 1 kW of solar generates ~4 units/day (annual avg).
*   *Result:* You need a **3 kW system** to offset this.

### 2. The Subsidy Logic
It instantly applies the **PM Surya Ghar** caps.
*   If you need 2 kW, it subtracts ₹60,000.
*   If you need 4 kW, it subtracts ₹78,000.

### 3. The 25-Year Horizon
This is where the simulation shines. It doesn't just show you today's saving. It projects the **cumulative savings** over the system's life.
*   *Investment:* ₹1.8 Lakh.
*   *Lifetime Savings:* ₹15 Lakhs+.

## Why "Shadow Analysis" Matters (Phase 2)

While our online tool gives you the financial picture, our on-site engineers perform the physical simulation.

We look for **Azimuth and Tilt**.
*   **South Facing:** Best generation.
*   **Shadow Casters:** That water tank or neighbor's building might cast a shadow at 4 PM in winter.

*Note: We are building a "Map-Based Roof Designer" directly into our website soon, which will let you draw obstacles and see shadow effects online!*

## Don't Fly Blind.

You wouldn't build a house without a blueprint. Don't install a power plant without a simulation.

Start with the financial model. If the ROI makes sense (and it usually does, with a 3-4 year payback), book a site visit for the physical analysis.
